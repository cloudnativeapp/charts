# Zookeeper

[Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or other by distributed applications.

## TL;DR;

```console
$ helm install <helm-repo>/zookeeper
```

$ helm install bitnami/zookeeper
## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Zookeeper](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-zookeeper) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters. This Helm chart has been tested on top of [Bitnami Kubernetes Production Runtime](https://kubeprod.io/) (BKPR). Deploy BKPR to get automated TLS certificates, logging and monitoring for your applications.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.4+ with Beta APIs enabled
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm install --name my-release <helm-repo>/zookeeper
```

$ helm install --name my-release bitnami/zookeeper
The command deploys Zookeeper on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Log level

You can configure the Zookeeper log level using the `ZOO_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. By default, it is set to `ERROR` because of each readiness probe produce an `INFO` message on connection and a `WARN` message on disconnection.

## Configuration

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the Zookeeper chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,
$ helm install --name my-release \
  --set auth.clientUser=newUser \
    <helm-repo>/zookeeper
$ helm install --name my-release \
```

The above command sets the ZooKeeper user to `newUser`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml <helm-repo>/zookeeper
```

$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml bitnami/zookeeper
> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Persistence

The [Bitnami Zookeeper](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-zookeeper) image stores the Zookeeper data and configurations at the `/bitnami/zookeeper` path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube.
See the [Configuration](#configuration) section to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.

## Upgrading

### To 2.0.0

Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed unless you modify the labels used on the chart's statefulsets.
Use the workaround below to upgrade from versions previous to 2.0.0. The following example assumes that the release name is `zookeeper`:

```console
$ kubectl delete statefulset zookeeper-zookeeper --cascade=false
```

### To 1.0.0

Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed unless you modify the labels used on the chart's deployments.
Use the workaround below to upgrade from versions previous to 1.0.0. The following example assumes that the release name is zookeeper:

```console
$ kubectl delete statefulset zookeeper-zookeeper --cascade=false
```
