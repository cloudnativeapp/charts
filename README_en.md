# Happy Helming in China!

Other Language: [中文文档](README.md)

## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the place where we open source Helm charts hosted on [Cloud Native App Hub](https://developer.aliyun.com/hub), short for AppHub. The AppHub is a mirror of [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh) hosted in China, fully open source & non-profit, and developed by three engineers from Alibaba Cloud with their 20% time. 

The reason we want to do this is: there're many container image URLs (e.g. gcr.io, quay.io) and Charts repo (e.g. storage.googleapis.com, AWS S3) are not available due to "networking issue" in China, which makes `helm install` is impossible.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To add the charts repo for your Helm client, run:

```
helm repo add apphub https://apphub.aliyuncs.com
```

**We strongly recommend** you to use Helm v3 and [here is the reason](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-preview-pt2/).

In case you are new to Helm, try the [Quickstart Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/) first.

## Chart Sources

### Charts from helm.sh

First of all, AppHub sync charts from [it's official repo](https://github.com/helm/charts) periodically.

And at the same time, AppHub localize these charts by replacing all unavailable URL in the chart, verify chart by a Kubernetes cluster (CI), and publish to AppHub portal.

These charts are located under `curated/`.

### User submitted charts

Users could submit any chart by creating a PR to this repo, and we would include them on AppHub after verify and PR merge.

These charts are located under `submitted/`.

### User submitted Charts Repo (coming soon!)

We also encourage user to submit their own Charts Repo, we are very happy to include it in AppHub. Eventually, AppHub will become a "aggregator hub" for every user's chart repo and we believe it's where Helm community is going to.

> This function is actively under developing.

Roadmap

We open source the [roadmap of AppHub here](https://github.com/cloudnativeapp/charts/projects/4) and we are eager to know your ideas about how to make it as a great Helm Hub mirror in China. 

The upcoming features including but not limited to:

1. "One click to install" to any cloud
2. Kustomize the YAML file
3. Enable user submit chart
4. Enable user submit charts repo
5. Open source all backend component including our "Charts Syncer"
6. Decentralize the hub: eventually, AppHub will become a "aggregator hub"
