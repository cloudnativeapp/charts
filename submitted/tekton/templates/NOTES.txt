This is a 3rd-party Chart integrate tekton pipeline and dashboard with image synced to aliyun for easy access in China.
If dashboard is enabled, to use it, run

kubectl --namespace {{ .Values.pipelines.namespace }} port-forward svc/tekton-dashboard 9097:{{ .Values.dashboard.port }}

Then you can access it through localhost:9097.
The uninstall process will delete the whole namespace `{{ .Values.pipelines.namespace }}` which may take a while to finish.
The original project locates at https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline and https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard. Lots of features are comming in the future.
NOTE: Jenkins-x-charts also has a chart for tekton locates at https://github.com/jenkins-x-charts/tekton/tree/master/tekton which does not include tekton dashboard.
